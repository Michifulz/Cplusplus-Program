This code solves the problem of needing two clocks, one with 12 hours and 1 with 24. Both needed to be able to be adjusted by the minute, hour, or second. I was quite happy with the hour the display and UI came out in this project. I felt like things ran smoothly and all the components work well together to give a good user experience. 

I think that it would be ideal for this code to have more of the functions calling from the main. I think things are still a little cluttered. I would like to see this code developed further by adding the ability to update automatically as well as manually. 

I spent quite a bit of time streamlining the time-changing process, ensuring that both clocks changed simultaneously. the main skill I will be transferring the skills I learned during this project is patience. Patience with myself, and with the code. Taking time to make sure things are done correctly and that everything is readable and well commented on has been very helpful for me. Ensuring things are well commented on allows me to fix my code, and also lets others see what I've coded and adapted it as well.
